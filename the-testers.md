## Testers

* apply their critical thinking skills to help customers consider all the
  possibilities when envisioning the product
* help identify holes in requirements
* act as technical investigators; provide information about the software's
  non-functional characteristics such as performance & scalability.

> Rather than relying on testers to find bugs for programmers to fix, the team
> should produce nearly bug-free code on their own. When testers find bugs, they
> help the rest of the team figure out what went wrong so that the team as a
> whole can prevent those kind of bugs from occurring in the future.

If you don't have dedicated testers, programmers and customers should fill this
role.
