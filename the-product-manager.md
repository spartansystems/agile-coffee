## Product Manager

The product manager's job is to _maintain_ and _promote_ the product vision.

* Documenting vision
* Sharing vision with stakeholders
* Incorporating feedback
* Generating features and stories
* Setting priorities for release planning
* Providing direction to the on-site customers
* Reviewing work in progress
* Leading iteration demos
* Involving real customers
* Dealing with organizational politics

A great product manager also has a rare combination of skills. In addition to
vision, he/she must have the authority to make difficult trade-off decisions
about what goes into the product and what stays out. She must have the political
savvy to align diverse stakeholder interests, consolidate them into the product
vision, and effectively say "no" to wishes that can't be accommodated.
