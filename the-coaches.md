## Coaches

XP teams self organize, which means that each member of the team figures out how
he/she can best help the team move forward at any given moment. Damn. :-)

XP leaders lead by example, helping the team reach its potential rather than
creating jobs and assigning tasks. To emphasise this difference, XP leaders are
called coaches.

A coaches work is subtle; it enables the team to succeed.

Coaches also help the team members maintain their self-discipline, helping them
remain in control of challenging practices such as risk-managment, TDD, slack
and incremental design.
