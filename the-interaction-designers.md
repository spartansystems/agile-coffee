## Interaction Designers

* Help define the product UI
* Their job focuses on understanding users, their needs and how they will
  interact with the product.
* Perform such tasks as interviewing users, creating user personas, reviewing
  paper prototypes with users and observing usage of actual software.
* Divide time between working with users and the team

XP produces working software every week... Designers have the opportunity to
take real software to users, and observe their usage patterns, and use that
feedback to effect changes as soon as one week later.
