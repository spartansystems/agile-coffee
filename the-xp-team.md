# The XP Team

Building a sizable software project never a simple or straightforward task and
often requires more than one person to complete the mission. As a project grows,
domain, product, and technical knowledge are spread out across many members of a
team. "XP acknowledges this reality by creating cross-functional teams composed
of diverse people who can fulfill all the team's roles".

Other than scheduled activities, everyone on the team plans his own work. Self
organization is the hallmark of agile teams.

## On-Site Customer

* responsible for defining the software the team builds
* most important activity is release planning
  - evangelize project vision
  - identify features & stories
  - determine how to group features into small, frequent releases
  - manage risks
  - create an achievable plan by coordinating with programmers and playing the
    game
* may or may not be real customers
* responsible for providing programmers with requirements details *upon request*
* typically product managers, domain experts, interaction designers and business
  analysts play the role of on-site customer.

> A great team will produce technically excellent software without on-site
> customers, but to truly succeed, your software must also bring value to its
> investors. This requires the perspective of on-site customers.

## Product Manager

The product manager's job is to _maintain_ and _promote_ the product vision.

* Documenting vision
* Sharing vision with stakeholders
* Incorporating feedback
* Generating features and stories
* Setting priorities for release planning
* Providing direction to the on-site customers
* Reviewing work in progress
* Leading iteration demos
* Involving real customers
* Dealing with organizational politics

A great product manager also has a rare combination of skills. In addition to
vision, he/she must have the authority to make difficult trade-off decisions
about what goes into the product and what stays out. She must have the political
savvy to align diverse stakeholder interests, consolidate them into the product
vision, and effectively say "no" to wishes that can't be accommodated.

## Domain Experts

Responsible for figuring out domain details and having _all the answers_ at
their fingertips. They are experts in their field.

Domain experts spend most of their time with the team, figuring out the details
of upcoming stories and standing ready to answer questions when programmers ask.

## Interaction Designers

* Help define the product UI
* Their job focuses on understanding users, their needs and how they will
  interact with the product.
* Perform such tasks as interviewing users, creating user personas, reviewing
  paper prototypes with users and observing usage of actual software.
* Divide time between working with users and the team

XP produces working software every week... Designers have the opportunity to
take real software to users, and observe their usage patterns, and use that
feedback to effect changes as soon as one week later.

## Business analysts

* Augment a team that already contains a product manager and domain experts.
* Continues to clarify and refine customer needs, but does so in support of the
  other on-site customers, not as a replacement for them.
* Analysts help customers thing of details they might otherwise forget and help
  programmers express technical trad-offs in business terms

## Programmers

The bulk of the XP team consists of software developers in a variety of
specialties. Each of these developers contributes directly to creating working
code. XP calls all developers _programmers_.

* Responsible for finding the most effective way of delivering stories in the
  plan
* Provide effort estimates, suggest alternatives and help customers create an
  achievable plan by playing the planning game.
* Spend most of their time pair programming.
* Using test driven development, they write tests, implement code, refactor and
  incrementally design and architect the application.
* Pay careful attention to quality and are keenly aware of technical debt.
* Ensure that customers may choose to release the software at the end of any
  iteration & strive to produce no bugs in completed software
* Establish coding standards that allow them to collectively share
  responsibility for the code.
* Have the right and responsibility to fix any problem they see.
* Help ensure the long-term maintainability of the product by providing
  documentation at appropriate times

## Designers and Architects

Everybody on an XP team codes, and everybody designs. TDD combines, design,
tests and coding into a single ongoing activity. Expert designers and architects
are still necessary and contribute by guiding the team's incremental efforts.

## Technical Specialists

Domain experts in specific technical disciplines:
* database designer
* security expert
* network architect
* etc.

## Testers

* apply their critical thinking skills to help customers consider all the
  possibilities when envisioning the product
* help identify holes in requirements
* act as technical investigators; provide information about the software's
  non-functional characteristics such as performance & scalability.

> Rather than relying on testers to find bugs for programmers to fix, the team
> should produce nearly bug-free code on their own. When testers find bugs, they
> help the rest of the team figure out what went wrong so that the team as a
> whole can prevent those kind of bugs from occurring in the future.

If you don't have dedicated testers, programmers and customers should fill this
role.

## Coaches

XP teams self organize, which means that each member of the team figures out how
he/she can best help the team move forward at any given moment. Damn. :-)

XP leaders lead by example, helping the team reach its potential rather than
creating jobs and assigning tasks. To emphasise this difference, XP leaders are
called coaches.

A coaches work is subtle; it enables the team to succeed.

Coaches also help the team members maintain their self-discipline, helping them
remain in control of challenging practices such as risk-managment, TDD, slack
and incremental design.

## Stakeholders

May include end users, purchasers, managers and executives. Although they do not
participate in day to day operations, invite them to attend each iteration demo.

The on-site customers are responsible for understanding the needs of the
stakeholders.

## Executive Sponsor

Is the one funding the project. Take care to identify the executive sponsor and
understand what they want from your project. They are your ultimate customers.
Be sure to provide with regular demos and confirm that the project is proceeding
according to their expectations.
